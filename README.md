# CS165
BYU-Idaho study course work completed in 2003

Before this class I had a fairly solid understanding of basic programming principles and skills. I had followed a self-directed educational program and learned the ANSI C Programming language. Here was my first experience into C++ and Object Oriented programming.
I actually skipped the prerequisite class for CS165 which was CS124. After reviewing CS124 it was way too basic for me. So instead, I got an A grade in CS165 and requested a vertical credit for CS124.
